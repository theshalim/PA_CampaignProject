        <h1><b>Bangladesh bans smoking in public</b></h1>
        <h3><i>Bangladesh has banned smoking in public places, in line with a United Nations treaty on tobacco control.</i></h3>
        <p>
            Parliament passed a law implementing the ban late on Sunday, setting a fine of 50 taka (80 US cents) for people caught smoking in places such as schools, offices, libraries, hospitals and airports.
        </p>
        <p>
            The typical daily wage of a farm labourer in Bangladesh is 60 taka, just under one US dollar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The law prohibits advertisement of tobacco products in cinemas, newspapers or on television in the country of 130 million people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The World Health Organisation said about half of Bangladeshi men and one-fifth of Bangladeshi women use tobacco in either smoking or smokeless forms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The global pact, signed by 167 nations, came into effect in February, despite what UN officials and activists say has been intensive lobbying by the tobacco industry.
